Resurrecting Caen HV code.

Wesley Moore did some code cleanup and organized the code to compile
within the directory structure created by makeBaseApp.pl.

He wrote template files and provided example substitution files so
that database records are created at run time.

Showed how to create an "ioc" application so that all apps on an IOC
are linked into a single munch file.  This leads to much cleaner boot
scripts.

SAW configured an instance of the code for a vx5100, called vmec7.  Setup
substitution file to configure two full crates.  Started modifying
template files so that the EPICS names are close to the names in the built
in EPICS on the SY4527.  Goal is to be able to build GUIs that have
channels from both types of crates.

5/4 Speed tests

With 2 full crates, 30 seconds to read everything.
Driven by stale out times.
Try:

#define  CAEN_STATUS_LONG_STALE_OUT_PERIOD   1000  /* 1 Sec */
#define  CAEN_STATUS_SHORT_STALE_OUT_PERIOD  500   /* 0.5 Sec */
#define  CAEN_PARAM_LONG_STALE_OUT_PERIOD    1000  /* 1 Sec */
#define  CAEN_PARAM_SHORT_STALE_OUT_PERIOD   500   /* 0.5 Sec */

Two crates now takes 10.85 seconds.
One crate 5.38 seconds

Fast readback only seems to work with parameters, not status (which
includes vmon and imon).

Try setting long param staleout and short status stale out.
30000,10000

Then status speeds up to 6.5 second for two crates.
